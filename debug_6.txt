# In computer science there is something 
# called binary search, or half interval
# search. It is an algorithm that finds
# the position of a value in a sorted
# array. 
# This type of algorithm can be thought
# of as a divide and conquer type of 
# algorithm. 
# Write a function that accomplishes
# binary search 
# print(binSearch([1,2,3,4,5],8))
# False
# print(binSearch([1,2,3,4,5],2))
# True
